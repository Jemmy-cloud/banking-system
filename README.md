# banking-system

banking system in NodeJS.

The backend service is based on Node.js and is built as REST API, with authentication using JWT tokens. Service is communicating with PostgreSQL database where the data about users, accounts, transactions and so on is stored.

One of the main concerns while developing the backend service were data consistency and reasonable performance. In application like banking software loosing consistency of the data is catastrophic
